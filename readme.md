# Deprecated

**Warning**: This repo has been deprecated. The OG GifBot was instrumental in laying a foundation for building teams bots. Unfortunately, due to the current lack of cross platform support for developing a C# bot GifBot has now been redone in typescript and can be found [here](https://github.com/alancast/RandomGifBot). A huge shoutout to Remy Jette for his help in building the OG GifBot!

GifBot is a bot that will provide you a gif at random from the string that you pass it. It can be connected to a variety of things, but the primary (and most tested) use case is in Microsoft Teams. It uses the Giphy API as the source of it's GIFs.
